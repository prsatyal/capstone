I know psychosis comes in episodes because I‚Äôve had times when it was worse than others‚Ä¶ but the depression just never goes away. I think it was initially caused by my dad leaving and OCD starting. Then it continued due to severe mental &amp; physical bullying at school and abuse at home. Then I got a boyfriend at 13 who was physically and sexually abusive. Then at around 16-17 my psychosis started and every since then life has been complete hell. When I was 20, I had my first real ‚Äúepisode‚Äù of psychosis which resulted in more PTSD and now I feel like I can‚Äôt leave my house without someone killing me. Sometimes I even feel like they‚Äôre going to kill me at home. This is really just a snippet of my life. There‚Äôs no escape‚Ä¶   \n",
       "2986  I have been dealing with a lot of mental health issues basically my whole life. I am formally diagnosed with psychosis NOS, OCD, GAD, MDD, PTSD, BPD, ADHD and have an informal ASD diagnosis. I also have dealt with disordered eating since I was 9 and I recently gained a lot of weight because of it. I‚Äôm on abilify and effexor and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping anything. What really gets me is the paranoia &amp; guilt that I experience on a daily basis and the depression that follows + depersonalization/derealization.  I also have emetophobia which practically controls my life.. I can‚Äôt have kids because of it. For the past week or so I‚Äôve just been getting drunk every day and smoking weed/doing high dose edibles. I started taking some courses at a community college and I‚Äôm falling behind really hard, with no real end goal in mind. I have no friends and my S/O resents me because of all of my issues.

       "3     Okay, so. Trigger warnings up the wazoo. \\n\\nI was out for drinks last week, got fairly far down the rabbit hole and very, very distinctly remember telling a near total stranger that I didn't really want to be alive. It's like I spilled a secret to myself more than them and it's kind of stuck with me ever since. \\n\\nIt's true. And worse, it's happened before and I forgot - or didn't quite have the words to express it or clock what was going on with me. \\n\\nI don't want to die. I don't even have thoughts about hurting myself. It crystallised when I was watching a TikTok where someone asked a question about how you'd feel if a truck was speeding toward you. If I was being honest with myself, it was a sigh of relief.  \\n\\nMy life, by all accounts, is great. I have a loving wife, we've just bought a house, I'm in the career I've always wanted to be, I'm lucky enough to have a lot of people I consider close friends. I've struggled with depression and extremely low self-esteem for my ent...   \n",

In a 4 Yr 'long distance' relationship with quite literally the sweetest person I could've ever met. The easiest, most healthy relationship. My literal life partner who I wish I could give everything to because he deserves it. Anyway. Im so broke with no savings, trying to get away from abusive parents. And when I say broke I mean broke. Being disabled is hard when you're young, and worse when you're broke and without many job options that won't put you in a wheelchair by 35.

It's crazy that is human we are expected to live life and not only be content but ne great full. I think it would be more concerning to have someone living a miserable life and seeming happy as a clam rather than want to end their life or at least do everything to get out of the situation. Why do psychiatrists act like depression and SI is so unusual and scary? It what millions of people deal with every day, and yet it's treated as something that should be worked on constantly. I'm not going to waste my energy trying to \"fix\" my depressed and ultimately not focusing on my actual life. I bet if any other species of animal reached the intelligence of a human many of them would be suicidal as well. This condition is a product of evolution and I really don't see why people should try so hard to fix it.   \n",

Can't find a job. Been searching for a long time. Have no money. Get constantly scammed in terms of job offer calls (very common where I live; people call you telling you the job is yours and then try to deceive you. Became a burden to my partner and family (it's damaging both relationships and, in fact, my partner decided we should take a break so we stopped talking). Have few to no friends. Have zero motivation to go on. Hate the country I live in. Always get reminded by social media of how amazing everyone else's lives are. How they can go to places, work at what they like, make money and love their significant others. Started using antidepressants. Got a psychiatric appointment scheduled for what seems like a thousand years from now. Feel ugly, fat, stupid, useless, like a loser.   \n",

       "1       Okay, so. Trigger warnings up the wazoo. \\n\\nI was out for drinks last week, got fairly far down the rabbit hole and very, very distinctly remember telling a near total stranger that I didn't really want to be alive. It's like I spilled a secret to myself more than them and it's kind of stuck with me ever since. \\n\\nIt's true. And worse, it's happened before and I forgot - or didn't quite have the words to express it or clock what was going on with me. \\n\\nI don't want to die. I don't even have thoughts about hurting myself. It crystallised when I was watching a TikTok where someone asked a question about how you'd feel if a truck was speeding toward you. If I was being honest with myself, it was a sigh of relief.  \\n\\nMy life, by all accounts, is great. I have a loving wife, we've just bought a house, I'm in the career I've always wanted to be, I'm lucky enough to have a lot of people I consider close friends.

It's crazy that is human we are expected to live life and not only be content but ne great full. I think it would be more concerning to have someone living a miserable life and seeming happy as a clam rather than want to end their life or at least do everything to get out of the situation. Why do psychiatrists act like depression and SI is so unusual and scary? It what millions of people deal with every day, and yet it's treated as something that should be worked on constantly. I'm not going to waste my energy trying to \"fix\" my depressed and ultimately not focusing on my actual life. I bet if any other species of animal reached the intelligence of a human many of them would be suicidal as well. This condition is a product of evolution and I really don't see why people should try so hard to fix it.   \n",

Im 16 years old, im a female, im 5'2, weigh 113 pounds and im mexican american. I have anxiety and depression from sexual, emotional and physical abuse from when i was young and because of fucking school. Ive always hated everything about myself, i wrote my first suicide note on the mirror of the 2 bedroom  apartment me and my family lived in with my moms lipstick when i was around 8. I dont remember exactly what i wrote, but it was pleading god to send me to heaven and to make my family to care enough to bury me. My mom was cooking, my dad was at work and my siblings were with my cousins. I sat in front of the mirror, starring at my reflection for what seemed like an hour but was probably 10 minutes. I was crying at how ugly and worthless i was. After those minutes, i got up and wiped the note off with a sock and left to play...   \n",

So for a little bit of context I have a little brother .He is 6 and I am 13.He often hits me.You may say that he's only 6 but once I made a joke that I ate his croissant and fully kicked me in the stomach and face with his leg.I kicked hik out of my room and my mom yelled at me because it was my fault.Multiple times he hit me in my nose while I wasn't even talking to him I was just staying on my phone and kicked me in the nose with his leg.He always starts fights and it's ALWAYS my fault for not reacting.My mom says I should hit him too and when I do she yells at me because I barely touched him.I also have a strong feeling that they just hate me.I have to just enter the room and I can see such a pure hatred in my dad's eyes . am I the bad one am I just a cry baby?   \n",

I ask where she's from and she names my country. I panic and ask where and she names somewhere thats like HALF AN HOUR away. \\n\\nCurrently, we're both coming up with stories so we can meet in real life and our parents think we're school friends. \\n\\nDon't worry. We've talked a lot. I know who she is. We're meeting in a public place too.   \n",
